            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>THere are three Diſeaſes in this Part. The ſtraitneſs, and the largeneſs, and Yard of a Woman.</p>
                     <p>The ſtraightneſs is, when the Cleft is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153163:10"/> that it will not admit a Mans Yard, or with much difficulty, it hinders Child-bearing; and if it be from the firſt confirmation, it is hard to be cured by Phyſick: but it is enlarged, either by copulation, or by bringing forth of children. Sometimes it is from an Ulcer, or from aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Medicines given unadviſedly, that they may appear to be Virgins, when they are not.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the cleft is ſhut up outwardly, and there is only paſſage for the Urin and the Terms: theſe Women are called <hi>Atretae,</hi> that is ſhut up, and bored, of which Chap. 3. Sometimes it is ſo cloſe, that neither Terms nor Urin can come forth.</p>
                     <p>The contrary to this, is largeneſs of the Cleft, or when there are more holes then Nature hath uſually, by often Copulation or Child-bearing. This laxity or largeneſs cauſeth Barrenneſs and falling out of the Womb, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſhews in the Nature of Women. And this makes women unpleaſant to men.</p>
                     <p>This is cured by purging after Child-bearing, by Fomentations, Baths, Liniments of Allum water, and the Decoction of aſtringent Plants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take Comfry roots, Bole, Sanguis Draconis, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate flowers, Allum, Maſtich, Galls, each half a dram: make a Powder, and with ſteeled Water make a Mixture, dip a Peſſary therein.</hi> Or, <hi>Take Oaken leaves, Plantane, each half a handful; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry roots an ounce, Pomegranate peels and flowers, Sumach, each half an ounce; Allum an ounce, boyl them in Water, and foment the Privites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sometimes in hard travel, the ſpace between the Fundament and the privy Cleft, is broken into one hole. <hi>Eros</hi> ſhews the Cure of it. <hi>Some put a long piece of Allum into the Cleft.</hi> When
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153163:10"/> there are divers paſſages in a Womans Privities it is from the firſt confirmation,<note place="margin">De paſſion, mulier. c. <hi>20.</hi>

                     <p>THe <hi>Alae</hi> or Wings in the Privities of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, are of ſoft ſpongy fleſh, like a Cocks-comb in ſhape and colour; the part at the top is hard and nervous, and ſwells like a Yard in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, with much ſpirit. This part ſometimes is as big as a mans Yard, and ſuch women were thought to be turned into men.</p>
                     <p>It is from too much nouriſhment of the part,<note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note> from the looſeneſs of it by often handling.</p>
                     <p>It is not ſafe to cut it off preſently:<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> but firſt uſe Driers and Diſcuſſers, with things that a little aſtringe; then gentle Cauſticks without cauſing pain, as burnt Allum, Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiacum.</p>

                     <p>Some Excreſcences grow like a tail, and fill the Privities: they differ from a Clitoris: for the deſire of Venery is increaſed in that, and the rubbing of the Cloaths upon it, cauſe luſt: but in an Excreſcence of fleſh, they cannot for pain endure Copulation, but you may cut off this better than a Clitoris, becauſe it is all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.</p>

                     <p>The Cleft alſo may be cloſed by a Wound or Ulcer, as in a woman who with the French Pox, had all eaten off, and it grew together after, only there was a little paſſage for Urin.</p>
                     <p>This is, either when the ſides grow together from an Ulcer, or when proud fleſh ſtops it up, which is ſometimes in the French Pox.</p>

                     <p>When it is in the Privities, it is to be ſeen:<note place="margin">The Signs.</note> but when in the Neck or Orifice of the Womb, it is not known, but when the Terms are to flow, or when they copulate: and it is either broken by the force of blood, or there is pain; and being Virgins, they are taken to be with child: for if it laſt long, the womb ſwells, and the whole body is blewiſh.</p>
                     <p>Theſe either hinder the Terms from the neck of the womb, or from the veins of it. If inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or ulcer was before, this diſeaſe may be ſuſpected to be; if there the cloſing be by the Membrane, the place is white; if by Fleſh, it is red.

                     <p>It is eaſier cured when it is from a Membrane only, becauſe it is eaſily cut or broken; that in the Orifice of the Womb is not to be cured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inſtruments cannot reach it.</p>
                     <p>Take away that which ſtops the paſſage,<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> a Membrane that is outward is eaſily cut: but if it be in the neck of the Womb or be fleſh, it is hard.

                           <hi>Mercurialis</hi> ſaith, That though a flux of Terms be immoderate: yet it hath its periods, and is without pain, and makes not the body lean, but it is contrary in the Haemorrhoids. But this is not true: for the body is not made lean alwaies by the Haemorrhoids, nor do the Courſes keep their periods alwaies.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the pain which is almoſt alwaies in the Haemorrhoids, they differ in that the terms flow from the veins of the womb and its neck: but the Haemorrhoids are when the blood flows too much to the veins that nouriſh the privities, and ſticks or is evacuated.</p>

                     <p>If matter ſtay there,<note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note> it corrodes and makes burroughs, and divides the parts, and makes a Callus; and when the matter is divided, the parts divided cannot unite.</p>

If it be hot and dry, the blood is yellow, thin and ſharp, and pricks the Privities.</p>
                     <p>If it be cold and moiſt, the blood comes late forth, with difficulty, and it is whitiſh and thin. If it be cold and dry, the Terms come forth very late, and with difficulty, and ſeldome continue till forty, and the blood is thick and little.</p>
                     <p>The third ſign is from Lechery: for they who have hot wombs, deſire Copulation ſooner and more vehemently, &amp; are much delighted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: they who are cold, do the contrary. The hot and moiſt are not tired with much Venery. The hot and dry have great Luſt and a Frenzy if they want it: but they are quickly tired, becauſe there are but few Spirits. If it be cold and moiſt, they are not ſoon lecherous, and are eaſily ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and if they miſcarry often, the womb is made colder, and they delight not in the ſport: but Copulation doth them good, and makes them more youthful. If it be cold and dry, they deſire not a man in a long time, and take no delight; becauſe the Spirits are few.</p>
                     <p>The fourth ſign is from often Conception: for the hot conceive often, and bring forth males or Viragoes, if the ſeed of the man agrees with it.</p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:153163:20"/>
                     <p>the cold doth the contrary.</p>
                     <p>A hot and moiſt Womb is very fruitful, if the man be well tempered; and though he be old and weak, yet ſhe will conceive by him. Sometimes they have twins, or over-do, and have a Mole.</p>
                     <p>Hot and dry are fruitful, but not ſo much as the former.</p>
                     <p>Cold and moiſt are hard to conceive, eſpecially when they are in years; when they are young, and the Seed of the man is hot and dry, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive males; but ſeldom well ſhaped or health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: and the woman while ſhe is with Child, is ſickly.</p>
                     <p>A cold and dry Womb is commonly barren; and if they conceive, the Mans Seed is hot and moiſt, they bring forth Females; and if Males, they are tall, and quickly look old.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes veſſels are cloſer by inflammation

                     <p>INflation is a ſtretching of the Womb with wind: it is called by ſome a windy Mole.<note place="margin">Math. de grad. in <hi>9.</hi> Rhaſis.</note> See <hi>Matthew de gradibus</hi> and <hi>Thadeus Dun, lib. miſcel. c.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>This wind is from a cold matter,<note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note> either thick or thin, contained in the Veins of the Womb, which overcomes the weak heat of the womb. It is gathered there by cold meats and drinks, or flows from other parts. Cold Air may be the cauſe alſo, if women that lie in expoſe themſelves to it. This wind is contained either in the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Veſſels of the Womb, or between the Tunicles.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſwelling in the region of the womb,<note place="margin">The Signs.</note> ſometimes reaching to the Navel, Loins and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma; and as wind increaſeth or decreaſeth, it ariſeth or abateth. It is different from a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, becauſe it is never ſwollen ſo high.</p>
                     <p>And leſt a Phyſitian be deceived, and take it for a Conception; obſerve the ſigns of women with child: for if one ſign be wanting, you may ſuſpect an Inflation. Alſo in Inflation the tumor increaſeth and decreaſeth: but in Conception it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:153163:27"/> ſtill increaſeth. Moreover if you ſtrike upon the Belly, there is a noiſe, but not in Conception.</p>
                     <p>It differs from a Dropſie in the Womb: for there is no ſuch heavineſs, they move more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, and the Belly is not ſo ſwelled, there were cauſes that bred wind, and things againſt wind do good.</p>
                     <p>It differs from a Mole: for there is in that a weight and hardneſs in the Belly, and when they move from one ſide to another, they feel a weight that moveth which is not in this, of which <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates.</hi>

                     <p>But becauſe Doctors and Midwives are often deceived, you muſt diſtinguiſh this from other Swellings.</p>
                     <p>When a woman is ſound, and uſeth a ſound man, the womb by degrees ſwells, and the child moves in its time; but often there is a Dropſie with Conception before or after: therefore in a Dropſie the tumor is equal, according to the largeneſs of the womb and belly, and not point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as in a woman with child.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If the woman be in years, and hath not conceived before, and hath a good colour, it is a ſign of a Dropſie rather then a Conception.

                     <p>You ſhall know whether it be from the fault in the womb principally, or from ſome other part, thus: If the Woman be of a good colour, and there were only ſome diſeaſes and cauſes that might hurt the womb, as abortion, hard travel, ſtoppage of terms, or too many of them, then the womb is chiefly affected. But if there be ſigns of a diſtemper in the whole body, or in the Liver or Spleen, and the colour is bad, it is conſent from other parts.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall know whether the water be in Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or in the Cavity of the womb, thus: If you find the Orifice of the womb cloſed, and there is little pain, it is in the Cavity.

The tongue is dry and black, with watching, doting, toſſing to and fro, the breſts are pufft up and pained. There is head-ach to the roots of the eyes, and a pain in the groyns, hips, midrif, pleura and ſhoulders: ſhort wind, and like a Pleuriſie, with loathing, vomiting, hickets. The belly is bound, the pulſe is ſmall, and often and weak, but at firſt darting and quick. And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the Womb be inflamed, the terms are ſtopt,</hi>

                     <p>WHen the womb falls out of the Privities, it is called <hi>Procidentia uteri;</hi> this is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153163:33"/> But the aſcent or going up of the womb is more unknown.<note place="margin">Euſtach. rud. lib. <hi>2.</hi> pract. c. <hi>5.</hi>
                        </note> Many grave Anatomiſts hold, That the womb doth aſcend, if ſweet things are applied to the Noſe. If to the Privities, that it deſcends. If ſtinking Scents come, the womb flies from them, and it is to be ſeen by breathing altered, and by ſome meats that the womb gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily deſires, and catcheth up.</p>

                        <hi>Galen</hi> overthrows this Opinion, and ſaith, that the womb doth move after a ſort, and aſcend; but it is very little, and not to be demonſtrated: Nor can it ariſe to the Stomach, it is tied with ſuch ſtrong Ligaments to its place; and when it falls out the Ligaments are extended by moiſture, and falling of it down. And there is no reaſon why the Ligaments, though looſe or wet, it ſhould go up ſo ſpeedily, and come down again. For falling down is by degrees, and it is not ſoon brought up again. And though it be enlarged in Conception, it is by degrees and equally, not ſuddenly in one ſide. Nor as the Ligaments made very looſe in Conception, and the bottom of the womb is not tied, the Ligaments being only on the ſides.</p>
                     <p>But this cannot be denied, which women af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they feel a body or ball moving about the Navel, and a Phyſitian or Midwife may feel it. Therefore let us inquire what it is, if it be not a womb. That Body which you may feel ſtir, is the Stones, and that blind Veſſel which <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopius</hi> found out, which he compared to the great end of a Trumpet, called <hi>Fallopius</hi> his Trumpet. For the Stones hang, and the body of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet is like a Pipe looſe and moving, and when they are full and ſwell with corrupt Seed and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, they move to and fro, and aſcend as high
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:153163:33"/> as the navel. And the ſtones with the Trumpet make this round tumor of the Womb,<note place="margin">Antropogo. lib. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>34.</hi> The Cauſes.</note> which is felt in women, as <hi>Riolanus</hi> obſerves.</p>
                     <p>Whatſoever makes corrupt ſeed in the ſtones of a woman, and fills them with evil vapors or wind, is the cauſe: of which in ſuffocation of the womb. For the cauſe is like in both, only in ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Symptoms are worſe, becauſe the evil va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors are then more freely carried by the veins, arteries and nerves, afflict the principal part.</p>
                     <p>The woman and others may feel a round bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſhe findeth a pain at her heart,<note place="margin">The Signs.</note> and ſhort breath, without ſleeping or doting, or other Symptoms, and there were cauſes that diſturbed the womb.</p>
                     <p>It is not dangerous, yet not to be ſlighted:<note place="margin">The Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick.</note> for it may turn to the ſtrangling of the womb, when theſe evil vapors move to the noble parts.</p>
                     <p>Let the aim be at the corrupt ſeed,<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> and vapors which muſt be diſcuſſed and evacuated, as in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation of the womb.</p>

                     <p>The Womb changeth its place, when the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which it is bound to the other parts are not in order. There are four, two above broad and membranous that come from the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritonaeum, and two below that are nervous, round and hollow. Beſides, it is bound to the great veſſels by veins and arteries, and to the back by nerves.</p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:153163:34"/>
                     <p>Now the place is changed when it is down another way, or when the ligaments are looſe, and it falls down by its own weight. It is drawn on one ſide, when the terms are ſtopt, &amp; the veins and arteries are full, thoſe namely which go to the womb: if it be a mole on the one ſide, the liver and ſpleen cauſe it, by the liver-veins on the right ſide, or the ſpleen on the left, as they are filled more or leſs.</p>
                     <p>It alſo falls down by the looſning of the parts, to which it is faſtned: but how that can be, it is not clear.</p>

                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>It comes from external cauſes, as from cold of the feet or loins, from leaping or fear, cutting of wood, or running down a hill, and the like,</hi> theſe make the ligaments moiſt and looſe. Alſo it may be from cold after child-bearing, getting into the womb when the terms flow, ſitting upon a cold ſtone, and the like.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Platerus.</note>Others ſay, It comes from the ſolution of the connexion of the fibrous neck, and the parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, and that is from the weight of the womb deſcending: this we deny not. But when the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments muſt be looſe or broken. But women in a dropſie could not be ſaid not to have the womb fall down, if it came only from looſneſs. But the cauſe in them, is the ſaltneſs of the water, which dries more then it moiſtneth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Signs.</note>If there be a little tumor within or without the privities like a ſkin ſtretched, or a weight felt about the privities, it is only a deſcent of the womb: but if there be a tumor like a Gooſe-Egg, and a hole at the bottom, there is at firſt a great pain in the parts to which the womb is faſtned, as the loyns, the bottom of the belly, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, and the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> from the ſtretching or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:153163:34"/> breaking of the ligaments: but a little after the pain abateth, and there is an impediment in walking. Sometimes blood comes forth from the breach of the veſſels, and the dung and urine are ſtopt, and a Feaver and Convulſion.</p>
                     <p>When it is near, it is eaſily cured; when old,<note place="margin">The Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick.</note> it is hard to be cured, but not deadly, only it is troubleſom and naſty. It hinders conception, and keeps terms from flowing orderly. If it be with pain, Feaver or Convulſion, it is deadly, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in women with Child.

                     <p>Firſt put it up before the air alter it,<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> or it be inflamed or ſwollen.

                     <p>The action of the womb is twofold: private and publick. By its private action, it makes its nouriſhment of blood that comes to it.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153163:38"/> By its publick action, it ſerves for generation. If the private faculty be hurt, and the nouriſhment not well made, there is a ſuperfluous moiſture, and then weakneſs without other faults of the Organ or unity divided.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note>The firſt Cauſe is diſtemper, when the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt qualities are changed, or when the natural heat is ſuffocated or diſperſed; or when the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult qualities are changed. Heat in the womb makes a diſtemper, if it be too much, by which the womb ſucks more then it can concoct; this is not properly weakneſs: but that diſtemper is weakneſs, when the action is either not done, or weakly done. But cold rather makes weakneſs in the womb, by which it cannot make the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of nouriſhment, hence excrements are heaped up, and it cannot perform its actions. Alſo a moiſt diſtemper makes weakneſs, by which it can neither keep ſeed nor child. It is alſo weak from looſneſs.</p>

                     <p>THere is pain in the body of the womb, with other diſeaſes ſometimes, as the Colick-pains woven in the bottom of the Belly, and in the Loins and Hips; and is called the pain of the Womb. It is often in women with child, as the inflammation of the womb. It is burning and beating, it binds the Belly, and ſtops the Urin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note>Solution of unity is the cauſe of all pains: and this is from the ſtretching of the Womb and its Veſſels, or corroſion. Stretching is from wind,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:153163:39"/> or clotted blood in the cavity of it, and when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot expel it by reaſon of the ſtraitneſs of the part, there is pain.</p>
                     <p>Alſo pain is from ſtretching of the veſſels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the terms flow, when they are cloſe, and the blood thick, and this pain is increaſed by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cold, eſpecially after heat. Sometimes there is a gathering of humors about the womb, when the terms flow, and are foul, and they get into the membranes, and ſtretch them. The ſame may be from corrupt Seed, that ſtretcheth the veſſels.</p>
                     <p>Or from ſharpneſs and corroſion in the neck of the womb,<note place="margin">The Signs.</note> when ſharp humors flow through it, and twitch it.</p>
                     <p>The pain is manifeſt, but let us look at the ſigns of the cauſes. If it be from clotted blood, there was a flux of the ſame, and the pain is fixed about the orifice of the womb. If there were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſes, the patient will relate. If it be from Seed, there is ſuffocation of the Womb.</p>

                     <p>If there be pain, and fear of fainting, look to that before the cauſe, with Anodynes and Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks if need be.</p>
                     <p>If it be from wind, ſee inflation of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>If it be from clotted blood, diſſolve and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate it, with hot and attenuating Medicines, made into Fomentations, Baths and Oyntments. It is good to apply Treacle to the region of the Womb, or put it in with Rue and Honey. Or give a Clyſter to the Womb, of Rue, Foenugreek-ſeed, and Oyl of Rue and Orris. Or give Treacle, and Cinnamon-water.</p>
                     <p>If the veſſels of the womb are not open enough
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:153163:40"/> for the terms. See in the ſtoppage of the terms.</p>
                     <p>If there be wind, make a Clyſter thus: Take <hi>Mercury, Mugwort, Calamints, Penny-royal, each a handful; Chamomil and Melilot-flowers, each half a handful; Faenugreek and Linſeed, each an ounce; boyl them; in a pint ſtrained, diſſolve Hiera, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta laxativa, each half an ounce; make a Clyster.</hi> Give <hi>Mugwort, Zedoary-water, Eſſence of Caſtor, Treacle, or Womans Aqua vitae, of which before.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Make a Clyſter for the Womb, thus: Take <hi>Mugwort, Calamints, Bettony, each half a handful; Gith, Cummin, Carrot, Aniſeeds, each a dram; Spike, Schoenanth, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, each a dram; boyl them in Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then fill an Ox bladder half full with Oyl of Lillies and Dill, and apply it to the belly.</p>
                     <p>Or, Take <hi>Oyl of Lillies, Orris, each an ounce; diſtilled Oyl of Angelica a dram, Gooſe and Hens greaſe, each half an ounce; Mucilage of Line and Faenugreek-ſeed made with Mugwort-water, each three drams; ſeeds of Cummin, Carrots, Caraway, each a dram; with Wax make a ſoft Oyntment.</hi> Or, Take <hi>Pellitory two handfuls, Mercury a handful, beat them, add Chamomil-flowers, Cummin, Aniſe, Carrots-ſeeds, each a dram; two yelks of Eggs and Oyl of Lillies, make a Cataplaſm for the Belly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Apply Plaiſters to the Navel, and Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes with great flame to the Region of the womb; or dry Fomentations of Oats, Milium, Aniſe, Cummin, Carrot-ſeed in a Bag.

                        <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> Of the Diſeaſes of the Womb, that come from ſweet ſcents and ſtinks.</head>
                     <p>THere is a particular Symptom in the womb which breeds great admiration, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in ſweet ſcents, and is offended with ſtinks. And it is certain: for if Muſk, Civit, or the like, be but put to the Noſe of the woman that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to fits of the Mother, they grow ſick; and if the ſame be put to their privities, and ſtinks to the Noſe, the fit of the Mother ceaſeth.</p>
                     <p>It is hard to give the reaſon of this, many wiſe Men have given their opinion: but they diſagree among themſelves, and ſatisfie me not, neither do I promiſe to ſatisfie others, But it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me that the womb is not delighted with ſcents, as ſcents: for the privities have no ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the ſenſe of ſmelling doth not reach ſo far: but the quality by which it is well or ill, is occult, and not to be explained, and to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the odours.</p>
                     <p>If any aſk what the quality is, I anſwer, There are many qualities in Nature that are hid from our ſenſes, and yet we cannot deny them, becauſe we ſee their effects, as the quality in a Dogs Noſe, we cannot apprehend but the Dog, perceives it.</p>
                     <p>But how theſe qualities come to the womb,<note place="margin">Quomodo uterus bene olentia recipiat.</note> is by no other way but by the open way by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, by which Spirits get into the womb, and in the ſuffocation of the womb ſweet things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:153163:41"/> becauſe they ſtrengthen it by a peculiar qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to diſperſe the venemous air, and draw down the ſpirits and humors. But if they be put to the Noſe,<note place="margin">Quomodo bene olentia hyſtericis noceant.</note> the womb conſents by the Sympathy of the organ of ſmelling, and the brain with it.</p>
                     <p>This is by the Nerves and Arteries, for the heart is preſently refreſhed with a ſweet ſcent, becauſe it preſently pierceth into it being ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and there is a great conſent of the womb with the brain and the ſmelling, as is ſeen by the tryal of Barrenneſs, by a Fume from <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi>

                        </note>But we muſt obſerve that ſweet ſcents are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to all Wombs, and ſtinks are not, but the ſame Symptomes are not in all Women from them; for they who have a Womb of a good conſtitution with no evil humors in it, endure ſweet things well, and delight in them, but they who are unclean, hate ſweet things, and oſten fall into fits by them, becauſe while the womb is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with that ſweet and hidden quality with which it hath a peculiar Sympathy, the evil hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that lie in the Womb (eſpecially if there be any corruption from Seed) and the Seed alſo are ſtirred, and when the Spirits flie up, they take the bad humors with them, and ſend bad vapors to the heart which cauſe ſuffocation, and others Symptoms. But when the ſame ſcents are put to the privities, the womb is refreſhed with them, and the Spirits are quiet, or move to the ſcents. And ſo the humors (if there be any) are ſtill, or elſe move downward. But ſtinks on the contrary, by reaſon of their Antipathy with the Womb, voided by the Spirits, and ſo the humors move downwards, and often there is an abortion thereby.</p>

                     <p>BY Divine providence the blood which is voided every month, is kept in when there is a Child. For if it be its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is not ill, but only ſuperfluous, till they conceive; nor is it more an Excrement then Seed and Milk.</p>
                     <p>The terms commonly begin at fourteen, and then the hair appears on the privities, the breaſts ſwell, and women begin to be lecherous, and the blood can no longer ſtay in the Veins, but breaks out at the Veins of the Womb.</p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:153163:42"/>
                     <p>In ſome they begin at twelve, and they are very luſtful commonly, and of ſhorter lives; they continue till fifty; and ſome till ſixty, and then ſtop. In ſome they begin at ſeventeen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. And in ſome they ſtop before fifty, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the variety of Nature and Diet.</p>
                     <p>Nature doth not ſend forth every day what is gathered, but ſtaies till the plenty offends, and doth only once in a month, otherwiſe it would be filthy and unpleaſant, and hinder Conception. Nor do they flow at one time in all exactly: but there are twenty two daies, or at moſt thirty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the purgings.</p>
                     <p>In ſome they laſt three daies, which was uſual in the time of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> In ſome four or five, or more, as their Liver is greater, or their diet is higher or lower.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, they ſhould bleed but a pint and half, or two pints: this is is not alike in all, but differs in reſpect of age and diet.</p>
                     <p>As for the quality, it muſt not be too thick nor too thin, but of a middle ſubſtance, without ſcent, of a red colour, yellower in cholerick perſons: in melancholick, black; in flegmatick, whiter, and it muſt flow without any great Symptom.</p>
                     <p>The paſſages are the veins of the womb, being double from the double branch on both ſides it, the Spermatick and Hypogaſtrick, that they may evacuate ſuperfluities from all parts.</p>
                     <p>And from this Deſcription of a natural Flux, you may gather what is preternatural.</p>

                        <p>If any thing abound, that is not required for nouriſhment of the parts, and is ſo much, that Nature cannot endure it in the body, the Womb draws it to it when it hath conceived, to make up the child: of which hereafter.</p>

                        <p>Writers diſagree about this.

                        <p>Others ſay they offend only in plenty: for if it were venomous, it would not be a whole month in the body, and it could not from the child, nor would Nature make Milk of it.</p>
                        <p>Therefore menſtruous blood only offends in quantity, and not in any manifeſt or hidden qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But it hath ſtrange qualities when it is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with bad humors, or is kept too long in the Body to be corrupted, and cauſe great Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms: but this is when it is mixed with bad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, or is out of its Veſſels, and ſo corrupt.</p>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note>When Terms are wanting, either blood is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or ſtopt. It is wanting, either becauſe it is not made, or diſperſed or turned to other uſes, for nature being more ſollicitous to preſerve the individual perſon, then to propagate the ſpecies, ſpends it in preſerving of the perſon.</p>
                     <p>Blood is not made from divers cauſes: as age, cold conſtitution of Liver, Heart, or a diſeaſe which diſtempers the bowels. Or often bleeding from great Veſſels, or from having many iſſues, which take from the blood.</p>
                     <p>It is ſpent other waies, as before ripe age, and when women are with child, or give ſuck, or in hot Natures, and fat women, in whom it is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fat. It is in vain to provoke Terms in theſe.</p>
                     <p>They are either external evident cauſes of ſtopping of the Terms, as too great labour, troubles, ſadneſs, fear; but theſe laſt do not only waſte the blood, but cool and corrupt it, and cauſe obſtructions,<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>The proper cauſes are, the ſtraitneſs of the paſſage, or evil conformation of the parts through which it ſhould flow. Or the cloſing of the womb, of which we ſpake, but I ſpeak here of the veſſels.</p>
                     <p>The uſual cauſe of obſtructions, is thick ſlimy humors, from the blood too thick, or mixed with melancholy which comes with it to the veins of the womb, and ſtops them.</p>

                     <p>This thick blood comes from a cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the ſtomach, liver and ſpleen, from thick and groſs food, and drinking cold water when the Terms flow.<note place="margin">Lib. de venae ſec. adverſus Eraſiſtrat.</note> So thought <hi>Galen</hi> in his time of the Roman women that drank Snow-water, and had few or no courſes.</p>
                     <p>Straightneſs is when the body of the womb is made thicker, either by Nature or other cauſes; as a cold and dry, or hot and dry diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Straitneſs is from compreſſion of the veſſels by a Scirrhus or hardneſs of the parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, as the ſtraight gut, or by the ſtone in the bladder, and the womb diſplaced.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The fleſh may grow together by a membrane that grows to the veſſels, or a ſcar af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a wound.

                     <p>IT is when it is too much or too long, and hurts any Woman, and brings diſeaſes: but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proportion of bleeding is not to be defined; but too much is loſt when the actions are hurt.</p>

                        </note>The immediate Cauſe is the opening of the Veſſels, and the immediate Cauſe is the blood in quantity or quality offending, or by its force or diſorderly motion.</p>
                     <p>Veſſels are opened by Anaſtomiſis, Diapede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, Diaereſis or ruption, or by Diauroſis or corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Anaſtomoſis is from a moiſt diſtemper of the Veſſels, which looſneth the Orifices: or from external cauſes, as Baths, hot and moiſt: or uſe of Aloes.</p>
                     <p>The flux is ſeldom too great from a Diapedeſis: for it is but a ſweating through. Ruption is from Plethory, when the terms have long been ſtopped, and then break out, and when the blood is hot by Air, Baths, &amp;c. The outward cauſes are, falls, ſtrokes, hard travel, great burthens lifted.</p>
                     <p>Eroſion is from ſharp blood or humor, or from Medicines that corode; as Peſſaries long kept. For this great Flux is chiefly from the Veins in the bottom of the Womb.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Signs.</note>The Flux of Blood is too great, when the ſtrength abateth, and Cachexy follows, with pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

                     <p>The ſigns of the cauſes. If it be from much blood, there are ſigns of plethory, and it eaſily clotted together. If the blood be ſharp and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, it is putrified in the womb, you ſhall know wateriſh blood by its colour, and the ſigns of that humour abounding: and if you dip a clout in it, and dry it in the ſhade, you may ſee it. If the womb be too moiſt, ſuch cauſes went before. If it be from breaking of Veins, they will tell you of violence. If it be from corroſion, it is little and ſlow, ſometimes pure, ſometimes ſerous.</p>
                     <p>It weakneth the whole Body,<note place="margin">The Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick.</note> the Liver and Bowels, there is Swounding, the Whites, and paleneſs, and Dropſie ſometimes. That which hath been long, is hard to be cured, and cauſeth death, and in an old woman it is deadly.</p>
                     <p>If there be fulneſs, abate the blood,<note place="margin">Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and keep it from flowing to the womb, revel it, repel, cool and aſtringe it, that it may not flow ſo faſt, and then amend the blood.</p>
                     <p>If it is from plenty of blood,<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> open the Liver-veins in the right Arm; bleed little and often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes better revulſion, and weakens not, open the Salvetella if there be weakneſs,<note place="margin">Gal. <hi>5.</hi> aph. com. <hi>50.</hi>

                     <p>For if blood be not bred in ſuch a quantity, that may prick Nature forward to expel it, the purging of it is differed, till there be enough to ſtir up Nature to expel it.

                     <p>IT is a foul excretion from the womb, white, and ſometimes blew, or green, or reddiſh, nor at a ſet time, nor every month, but diſorderly, longer or ſhorter. Before or after the Terms, and when they are ſtopt. Virgins ſeldom have this diſeaſe, and women with child have it ſometimes.</p>

                     <p>It differs from the running of the reins; for it is in leſs quantity, whiter and thicker, and at a greater diſtance. It differs from night polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is only in ſleep with the imagination of Venery.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſe is an excrementitious humor, flegm, choler or melancholy.<note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note> Sometimes it is like wateriſh blood. It is gathered in the whole body, or in the ſtomach, liver or ſpleen. For they who have crudities in the ſtomach, are ſubject to this diſeaſe. Sometimes the womb alone is diſtempered after often miſchances, or when the womb is very cold and moiſt.</p>
                     <p>This matter flows through the veins of the womb, or of the neck of it, which uſe to carry blood, and Nature abuſeth them to carry excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, eſpecially if they are bred in the womb.</p>
                     <p>The remote cauſes are whatſoever doth breed bad humors; ſome have it after ſtrong purges, or long bathing.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes they are pale, ſometimes blew, red,<note place="margin">The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</note> wateriſh, and green: ſometimes ſlimy, or cold, or ſharp, or ſtinking. In young people it is red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh.</p>
                     <p>The face is diſcoloured, the urin thick,<note place="margin">The Signs.</note> there is loathing and heart-ach. If the humor be ſharp and corrupt, there is a Feaver.

                     <p>If it be not bred in the womb, the humor is from a Cacochymy. If it be from a fault in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, the ſigns of that will appear. If it come only from the Womb, there will be but little: If from the whole body, there will be more.</p>

And the worſe the humor is, the greater is the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Cure.</note>It muſt not be ſuddenly ſtopt, leſt it go to the noble parts.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, ſee whether it be from the whole body, or any part, or from the Womb it ſelf. If from the whole body, which is often, make general evacuation, and turn the humors from the womb, and keep a good diet, leſt they come again.</p>
                     <p>I allow not bleeding in the arm, if the terms be ſtopt; for they cauſe a Cacochymy, which admits no bleeding. Moreover the maſs of blood may be made foul by them, therefore find out whether it comes from Cacochymy or Plethory. And when it is moſt like to come from Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy, bleed not.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if flegm abound, which is moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, after general purging, conſume the reliques with Guajacum and Sarſa, and a drying diet, and by provoking Urin, of which hereafter.</p>
                     <p>If ſharp and cholerick humors abound, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them with gentle aſtringents, as Succory, Endive, Sorrel, to prepare, purge with Rhubarb, Triphera Perſica, aggregative Pills, and Pills of Rhubarb. If it be melancholy, do as in melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
                     <p>If it be water, cure it as <hi>Galen</hi> did the Wife of <hi>Boethus c.</hi> 8. <hi>lib. de prognoſt. ad Poſth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be in the ſtomach, liver, or the like, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it from increaſe, and becauſe it is moſt about the ſtomach, give a Vomit, but not too ſtrong. Then ſtrengthen the ſtomach with hot
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:153163:55"/> and dry Medicines. If Choler abound, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper is hot, and then cool it.</p>
                     <p>If it come from the Womb, do as I ſhewed, from what cauſe ſoever it is. Baths are good to evacuate and divert, and ſtrengthen, and take away a moiſt diſtemper, provided they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Uſe Dryers and Aſtringents. As, Take <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of red Roſes four ounces, of Succory two ounces, red Coral, Snakeweed, Tormentil-roots, Ivory, each two drams; with Syrup of Mirtles make an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But uſe not theſe Aſtringents, till the Body be purged, leſt the wateriſh humors be ſtopt, and the Belly ſwell: but you may uſe hot Dryers ſafely, as Treacle, Mithridate, with Conſerve of Roſes and Wormwood.</p>

                           <hi>Queſtion 1.</hi> Whether doth the <hi>Hymen</hi> which is the ſign of Virginity, appear in all Women?</head>
                        <p>Some ſay there is no ſuch thing, and if a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane be there, it is preternatural, and a diſeaſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:153163:57"/> in the Organ, called the Cloſing of the Womb.</p>
                        <p>Some famous Phyſitians and Anatomiſts ſay, There is a Hymen, which is the ſign of Virginity. It is, they ſay, a Membrane wrinkled with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcles like Mirtle-berries, like the bud of a Roſe half blown: hence came the word <hi>[Deflower.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I think with the Ancients, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in theſe parts that diſtinguiſheth Virgins from Women, which is violated in the firſt Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: many ſay they have it, and we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. For it is certain, that there is an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at firſt in Virgins, which cauſeth pain and bleeding, which is a ſign of Virginity.</p>
                        <p>But what this is, it is not yet known manifeſtly. Some ſay, it is a nervous Membrane, with ſmall Veins which bleed at the <hi>firſt bout.</hi> Some ſay, there are four Caruncles tied together with ſmall Membranes. Some have obſerved a fleſhy Circle about the Nymphae with obſcure little Veins, which makes the Membrane not to be nervous but fleſhy.</p>
                        <p>To be ſhort. I ſuppoſe it to be certain, that the part which receives the Yard, is not in them that have uſed a man, as in Virgins, nor is it alike in all; and this hath cauſed the diverſity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Anatomiſts. Moreover this is not found in all Virgins, becauſe ſome are very luſtful, and when it itcheth, they put in their finger, or ſome other thing, and break the Membrane: ſometimes the Midwives break it.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Africans</hi> had a Cuſtome to ſhut the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom and the Bride up in a Chamber,<note place="margin">Ex Leone Africans.</note> after they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:153163:58"/> were married, till they prepared the Wedding-dinner. And an Old Woman ſtood at the door, to receive a bloody ſheet from the Bridegroom, that ſhe might ſhew it in triumph to all the Gueſts, and that then they might feaſt with joy. And if there was no Blood to be ſeen, the Bride was to be ſent home to her Friends with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and the Gueſts went ſadly home without their Dinner.</p>
                        <p>Some ſay from Experience, that ſome honeſt Virgins have loſt their Maiden-heads without bleeding, and that it is a certain ſign of Virginity when they bleed, and when they do not, they are not to be cenſured as unchaſt. I hold that young Virgins will bleed, but when they are in years, by reaſon of the long continuance of the Terms, the parts are harder and longer; and if the mans yard be ſmall, there is no neceſſity of bleeding. Or if the Girle was wanton afore, and by long hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, hath dilated the part, or broke it, there is no blood after Copulation. Therefore <hi>Deut. chap.</hi> 20. the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is taken for that which hapneth often, and for the moſt part. And there can be no more gathered from hence, but bleeding is an undoubted ſign of Virginity. The ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>African</hi> Cuſtome.</p>

For when the way to the womb is ſtopt, the blood returns to the great Veſſels and Bowels, and choaks their heat, and ſtops the veſſels, and ſpoils the making of blood, and then there are crudities, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the habit of the body, cannot be united perfectly to the parts, and cauſe a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexy, which is the way to a Dropſie and Leuco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmacy, and divers Symptoms. The cauſes of the obſtructions of the Veſſels of the Womb, are crude humors, and flegmatick, ſlimy blood,

Sometimes they vomit. If vapors fly to the Head, there is thirſt and head-ach: and if Melancholy be mixed, the animal actions are hurt.</p>

                     <p>The conſent with other parts, is from likeneſs of parts, nearneſs, or connexion of Veſſels. And becauſe the womb is membranous, it hath a great conſent with the Membranes and Nerves. Alſo the parts adjacent are eaſily infected. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it hath conſent with all the Body by Veins, Arteries and Nerves.</p>
                     <p>It conſents with the Brain by the Nerves, and Membranes of the Back-marrow.

It conſents with the ſtomach by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomoſis in the Veins of the Meſentery, and by the Arteries through foul humors and vapors go from the womb to the Meſentery and Stomach.</p>
                     <p>It conſents with the Spleen by the Arteries; therefore many Women that had not their terms enough in their youth, and have hot blood, are after Hypochondriack, and a Phyſitian can ſcarce diſtinguiſh theſe diſeaſes of the Womb and Spleen, nor cure them ſeverally.</p>

It chiefly aſcends to the Gullet, and cauſeth choaking, as eating of Muſhrooms, Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore, and other poyſons.

                     <p>It is an immoderate deſire of Venery, that makes women almoſt mad, or a Delirium from an immoderate deſire of Venery: it is without a Feaver, and with heat, and tends to madneſs. There are degrees in it, for modeſt women have it, but will not for ſhame declare it, and die of Conſumptions. Others will not conceal it, but ſpeak their thoughts bawdily, and follow men, and ſollicite them ſhameleſly, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes in his Book of Virgins Diſeaſes.</p>

                     <p>The heat and ſharpneſs of Seed, is from the heat of the womb that breeds it, from hot humors in the womb and hot blood.</p>
                     <p>The outward Cauſes, are hot meats ſpiced, ſtrong wine, and the like, that heat the privities, idleneſs, pleaſure, and dancing, and reading of bawdy Hiſtories.</p>

                     <p>IT is a Delirium with ſadneſs, trouble and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, ſometimes laughing, without a Feaver.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:153163:68"/> It differs from others by the efficacy only of the efficient cauſe: for it hath divers pains beſides ſadneſs, eſpecially on the left ſide, near the Heart in the Pap: this is by occaſion at a diſtance.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe is a melancholick Vapor from a melancholick blood in the veſſels near the Heart,<note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note> that infects the animal Spirits, hurts the Fancy, and ſo the reaſon. For melancholick blood aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the veſſels of the womb, comes back to the great Arteries about the Heart, by the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the womb, and infects both vital and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, and cauſeth trouble of Heart and Delirium, while this blood is quiet in the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, there is no vapor that riſeth: but when it is heated or ſtirred up by any cauſe, the Arteries about the Back and Spleen beat more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and the vapors ariſe and trouble the Heart.</p>
                     <p>They are ſad, and full of thoughts,<note place="margin">The Signs.</note> and trouble at the Heart, and cannot expreſs their grief; all things are tedious to them: they weep and laugh without a cauſe: they ſleep little, and with trouble and fear: they have a pain on the left ſide, and ſometimes the left Breaſt: their Jaws are dry. All which are the effects of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick vapor, and when that is diſcuſſed, all ceaſe. If it be old, it turns to Madneſs, and then they are firſt ſilent, then pratlers, and think they ſee Ghoſts.</p>

                     <p>The ſame malignant vapor that cauſeth ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, cauſeth this: for when it aſcends by the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:153163:69"/> Veins and Arteries, it begets other diſeaſes: but when it gets to the Nerves, or to the fountain of them, it cauſeth the Epilepſie. In ſome the whole body hath a Convulſion; in others ſome part only, as the Eyes, Head, Tongue, Hand or Leg, and the outward Senſes are diverſly taken. Some ſee not, ſome hear not, ſome ſee and cannot ſpeak: ſome dote, and think they ſee ſtrange things, ſome cry out, and know not why. All loſe the ſenſe of Feeling.</p>
                     <p>If the vapor be not very malignant, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their work after the fit, as if they had not been ill.</p>
                     <p>It is known by what hath been ſaid: for here is not only a Convulſion, as in other Epilepſies: but divers Symptoms, as in Suffocation of the Womb. They ſeldom foam at the mouth, becauſe the Brain is not ſo ſhaken as to cauſe foaming: nor is the vapor ſo fixed in the roots of the nerves, but they often do hear.</p>
                     <p>It is grievous, and hath grievous Symptoms: but it is not ſo bad as a true Epilepſie. And if you give proper Medicines, it never returns.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> Of Barrenneſs, and want of Conception.</head>
                     <p>Man or Woman may be luſtful, and copulate, and yet there may be no conception, or ſhe may conceive too many, as Twins, or more, or have one conception after another, which is called Superfoetation, or ſhe conceives a Mole or Monſter.</p>
                     <p>Conception is of fruitful ſeed ſpent by a man, and mixed with a womans ſeed to perfection for the making of a child by the retentive and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:153163:75"/> faculty of the womb; hence it is neceſſary that both ſeeds be fruitful, that is, hot, full of Spirits, and well tempered, and a fit ſubject for a Soul, and that both ſpend at a time, and there be mixed and retained together, to produce a child.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the ſucking of the womb is neceſſary, and that it ſhould lay it up and embrace it, ſo that there be no ſpace between the Seed and the Womb. Sometimes the womb greedily ſnatcheth and embraceth the ſeed, but doth not keep it, but lets it come forth two or three dayes after, or keeps it to no purpoſe, and brings it not to action, as in a falſe conception or mole. Moreover, there muſt be blood in readineſs to get the child, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkle it when it is firſt formed, and to nouriſh it after.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if terms be wanting as in girls, or be ſtopt, or gone as in old Folk, expect no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. If they flow not by reaſon of labour and too much exerciſe, the conception is not hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if there be but blood enough to form the child. Hence it is, that women that are brought in bed, conceive again before they have their terms.</p>
                     <p>If all theſe be right, there is conception, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhe is barren, which is an impotency of the womb, that keeps it from ſucking in of the ſeed, or from retaining, or from nouriſhing it, and bringing it into act.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note>The firſt is impotency in copulation, from the cloſing of the womb, of which before: or other evil conformation of the privities, or an ulcer, or tumor in the neck of the womb. The ſecond is the breeding of unfruitful ſeed, from diſtemper of the veſſels and ſtones, or too tender and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:153163:75"/> a conſtitution. In men at eighteen, in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at fourteen, and men ſeldom get children after ſixty, and women ſeldom bear them after ſixty.</p>
                     <p>As for evil conformation to breed ſeed:<note place="margin">Faelix Plat. lib. <hi>1.</hi> obſer. tit. de vitalis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus defectu.</note> ſome have wanted Seed-veſſels, or they were not in their places. Some women are barren by the firſt Husband, and have children by the ſecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there muſt be a certain proportion between both ſeeds: and if they be wanting, they are barren, which proportion is hard to be explained, and almoſt impoſſible: for we muſt not ſtay in the firſt qualities, for there are occult qualities in ſeed, by which they agree or diſagree.</p>
                     <p>The third cauſe is, when the womb ſucks not in the ſeed, nor receives it in a right manner, as when the attractate faculty is hurt, or hindered by divers diſtempers of the Womb, or when a woman hates her husband.</p>
                     <p>Attraction is hindered by tumors or ulcers in the Womb, or by its being diſplaced,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Aph.</hi> 46.</note> as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates: They who being too fat, and conceive not, the mouth of their Womb is ſtopt up with the Cawl, and they conceive not till they are lean.</hi> But the more probable reaſon of not conceiving, is the matter of the ſeed turning into fat.</p>
                     <p>The fourth cauſe is, the retenſion of the ſeed hurt by a moiſt diſtemper, then the Womb is weak, and the fibres are looſe, ſo that it cannot contract it ſelf to retain; and the ſeed by reaſon of its ſlimineſs, cannot ſtick there. Alſo if the Womb be too thick, not fleſhy and ſoft, and be not ſprinkled with blood, as it is in ſome by birth which makes them barren, and in ſome after they ceaſe to conceive.</p>
                     <p>If the orifice of the womb gape after hard tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:153163:76"/> and abortion, by which the fibres are looſned and weakned, and the retention of the ſeed hurt. And if a woman after Copulation cough, neeſe, cry out, dance, or be angry, or frighted, the ſame may be.</p>
                     <p>The fifth cauſe of Barrenneſs, is the hurt of the altering faculty, which brings in the form and act into ſeed: for if there be not a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the womb and the ſeed, there is Barrenneſs, as Seeds are choaked in Marſhy-ground, or die, or are burnt in dry and ſandy ground: ſo mans Seed is ſuffocated in a moiſt womb,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Aph.</hi> 52.</note> and dryed up in a hot. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaks of the true proportion of the womb, as it is fit to cheriſh this or that ſeed, thus: <hi>Women that have thick and cold wombs conceive not, and they whoſe womb is too moiſt: for they quench the ſeed. Nor do they conceive that have dry and burning wombs: for the ſeed is corrupted in them for want of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They who are of a mean temper between theſe, are fruitful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The laſt cauſe of Barrenneſs, is want of Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrual-blood, which is neceſſary for the firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the child. Therefore Nurſes that have much milk conceive, becauſe the blood is carried to the Breaſts.</p>
                     <p>Therefore all theſe cauſes are reduced either to impotency in Copulation, or diſtemper of the Stones and Seed-veſſels, or evil conformation, or a cold and moiſt diſtemper of the Womb, which cannot attract, detain, and alter the ſeed; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a hot and dry diſtemper that cannot nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the ſeed, or from the enlarging of the Orifice after Child-bearing, or from Humors, or being diſplaced, or the ſtraitneſs of the Veſſels, or want of Terms, or too many.</p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:153163:76"/>
                     <p>Hence we may gather, that barrenneſs is oftner from a fault in the women than the men: for in men there is nothing required but fruitful ſeed ſpent into a fruitful womb. But women beſides the meeting of their own ſeed, muſt receive, retain, and nouriſh the mans; and afford matter for the forming of the child, in which divers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents happen, and any of theſe will cauſe Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs.</p>
                     <p>Mark alſo in theſe kinds of cauſes, that ſome do not properly cauſe barrenneſs: but only hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conception for a time, as the cloſing of the womb, ſmalneſs of the privities; theſe do not ſimply cauſe barrenneſs.</p>
                     <p>Some bring other external cauſes,<note place="margin">Ioa. Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus cap. de ſteril.</note> as eating the heart of a Deer, or if ſhe wear Jet about her, or if Harts-tongue be hanged about her bed: if ſhe walk over the Terms of another, or tread upon them unawares, or anoint with them, or put the juyce of Mints into her womb.</p>
                     <p>Some are born ſo, from a fault in the womb:<note place="margin">The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</note> others are not ſimply barren, but in reſpect of the man, and when they have another Husband, are fruitful. Some are barren till the conſtitution of the womb be changed. Some bring forth at firſt, and then by ſome fault grow barren.</p>
                     <p>How ſhall we know that a Women is Barre?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, ſee if the fault be in the man or woman,<note place="margin">The Signs.</note>

Search if ſhe hath good ſeed anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the man, or whether ſhe hath uſed quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of ſeed. You may know that ſhe ſpendeth little or no Seed, if ſhe hath little or no pleaſure in the act. Unfruitful Seed is known by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in the womb, a cold and moiſt diſtemper,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:153163:77"/> the ſigns whereof are mentioned; a foul body ſhews the ſame: for good ſeed cannot be made of bad blood.</p>
                     <p>It is hard to find whether the two ſeeds have the right proportion, or the womb agree with the mans ſeed. Yet temperate with temperate are very fruitful, becauſe they are both of a good conſtitution. But intemperate couples are bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren: but if one temper be good, it may mend the other, and ſhe may conceive.</p>
                     <p>If it come from a Medicine that deſtroys the ſeed, ſhe will tell. If Inchantment be the cauſe, though they love: yet they cannot copulate. Or whereas they loved each other, now they fall out without a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Aſk the woman how her womb doth attract, retain, and cheriſh the ſeed. If it have a tumor, or have matter or not? Whether there be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hereditary imperfection? Enquire concerning her Family, if many were barren, whether ſhe hath had hard travel or abortion? Whether the ſeed comes away preſently after, or at a diſtance, after ſome dayes; if ſo, then the womans ſeed is unfruitful, or there is a diſtemper in the womb that keeps it from cheriſhing the ſeed.</p>
                     <p>If the Terms be wanting, they are Viragoes, and have hair on their Chins, or they are fat, and ſeed turns into fat; or they are very lean, becauſe they want blood.</p>

                     <p>COnception is an action of the womb, after fruitful ſeed both male and female is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, mixed and nouriſhed, and its ſtrength is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to do its office. Seed and Coema differ; ſeed is that which comes from both male and female, but Coema is that which is mixed of both, and is called Conception, which produceth a child.</p>
                     <p>This Conception is preſently when two ſeeds meets in the womb, in leſs then ſeven hours after they are ſpent, if the heat of the Womb preſerve them, Nature is not idle a moment, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls to conformation.<note place="margin">Lib. de genit.</note> Therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, that the beginning of Conception is to be reckoned from the day that the Seed is retained, and if ſhe conceives not from the weakneſs of the ſeeds or womb, the ſeed will fall out in ſeven days; for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Lib. de ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim. partu. <hi>3.</hi> De hiſt. ani. c. <hi>3.</hi>

                        <hi>That Conception and Abortion are judged in the ſame time, as a diſeaſe, health, and death are judged.</hi> And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>If ſeed remains within till the ſeventh day, there is certain Conception.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for Formation, the Soul lying in the ſeed, makes its own houſe, for all acknowledge a form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty, and you muſt then ſuppoſe there is a ſubſtance from whence this faculty flows. And though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that ſeed is a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in power; not that there is not the eſſence of the Soul in the ſeed, and that it is not a living creature in reſpect of the firſt act, but becauſe it is not come to the ſecond act, for want of fit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, which being perfected, it hath the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:153163:80"/> act and all its operations, which for defect of Organs, it cannot produce.</p>
                     <p>There are divers opinions of the time of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation they are beſt that ſay the membranes are firſt made, which wrap the child with the Navel-veſſels, by which it is joyned to the Mothers womb, and receives nouriſhment for the child. Then all other parts are made ſooner or later, as the child requires for dignity or neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>We intend here to ſpeak of womens diſeaſes. Therefore there are three things required for the Formation of a Child. 1. Fruitful ſeed from both parents, in which the Soul remains that hath a forming quality to make its own habitation. 2. The Mothers blood is required to enlarge the Child to perfection. 3. There is required a good conſtitution of the womb to nouriſh the ſeed, and ſtir the concealed force. If theſe three be right, there is a child that is ſound and perfect, that will be born: but if any of theſe be wanting, there are Twins or more, and other faults, of which in order.</p>

                     <p>NAture hath ordained that a woman ſhould conceive but one child, in theſe and other Countries eſpecially, and that every year; yet in many places ſhe hath more, one had five at every birth, twenty at four lyings in. A <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> the Counteſs of <hi>Holſterne,</hi> in the time of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, had three hundred ſixty four at one labour. And another Counteſs in the time of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Eleventh, had five
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:153163:80"/> hundred and fourteen children at once, being Boys: theſe are ſo ſeldom, that they ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeak nothing of the Cauſes of ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Productions, but of Twins, or Three,<note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note> or Four. It is certain they are got at one time: and this differs from Superfoetation, which is at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times. And you muſt not impute it to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Cells of the womb: for women have no ſuch Cells, but only a Line that divides the left-ſide from the right; but it comes from the diviſion of the ſeed into divers parts, and the leaſt forming force in the ſide is compleat, and makes a child of every part of it. And becauſe the cavity of the womb cannot admit ſo many parts of ſeed, being no bigger than a Bean; and if it do admit them, how can the ſeed be divided at one copulation into ſo many parts? I ſuppoſe that ſuch women have naturally a larger womb, ſo that much ſeed is divided. And as Twins are begot at the ſame time, ſo they have but one Placenta, or part that receives the Navel-veſſels of both, but they have their ſeveral Coats.</p>
                     <p>It is hard to know whether a woman have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Twins, onely their belly is not even,<note place="margin">The Signs.</note> but divided with ſeams and wrinkles; and the weight is commonly greater, and the motion is not one not alike.</p>
                     <p>If a woman have two children, and be weak,<note place="margin">The Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick.</note> ſhe is in danger in her travel.

                     <p>IT is ſeldom that a woman hath many children at divers Copulations, but it is ſometimes, and is called <hi>Superfoetation,</hi> that is, a new concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after a former.<note place="margin">5. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 15.</note> Though <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes, <hi>That the mouth of the Womb after Conception is ſo ſhut, that you cannot put in a Needles point,</hi> yet a woman with child may take ſuch pleaſure after, that ſhe may a little open the womb to receive ſeed again, and draw it in, which may form another child.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. 7.</hi> Of the ill Formation of the Child.</head>
                     <p>IN the Formation of the child, there are divers Symptoms. 1. In the weakneſs of the child. 2. The parts are more or fewer to which you may refer Hermaphrodites. 3. The parts are greater or leſs, as Dwarffs or Gyants. 4. There is ſome part out of place or ſhape, as Hiſtories ſhew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly.</p>
                     <p>You muſt find the Cauſes in the ſeeds, terms,<note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note> womb, and error in Formation: the cauſe of theſe is the action hurt of the forming faculty. This is not always from it ſelf, but from the unfitneſs of the matter, and fault in the place which keeps it from the intention: for actions of active things are not but in a diſpoſed patient. Sometimes there is an extraordinary cauſe, as imagination, when the Mother is frighted, or imagineth ſtrange things, or longeth vehemently for ſome meat which if ſhe have not, the child hath a mark of the colour or ſhape of what ſhe deſired, of which there are many Examples.</p>
                     <p>But I doubt whether all errors in Formation, depend together upon the imagination; for the ſpirits and humors are troubled by the paſſions of the mind, and ſo ſlow forceable immediately to the womb or other part, and this diſturbs the forming faculty in its work.<note place="margin">Authoris ſententias</note> Alſo the forming faculty being overcome with plenty of humors, or wanting ſpirits that are gone another way, may by chance make an ill ſhape; therefore the paſſions of the mind are the firſt cauſes of errour in Formation, and imagination helps by ſtirring
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:153163:82"/> up the appetite. Theſe are the common errors of Formation.</p>
                     <p>Others are determinate errors, not ſimply from the imagination by the paſſions which have no determination to ſuch a thing; but no other cauſe can be beſides the imagination, but how ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the forming faculty for the producing of ſuch effects, it is hard to be underſtood, but there muſt be ſome imagination, and the forming fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that it may impart the ſpecies ſent from the external ſenſes to the forming faculty.</p>
                     <p>And this is the cauſe of the conſent of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and lower faculties: for the ſoul is the ſame in the whole body, and every where fitted with the ſame faculties, but it doth not exerciſe all in all parts, but by the proper determinate Organs or Inſtruments.</p>
                     <p>And though the child hath its ſoul, yet while it is in the womb, it depends upon the ſoul of the mother, as the fruits partake of the life of the tree while they are upon it, therefore it is probable, that whatſoever moves the faculties of the ſoul in the mother, may move the ſame in the child: Hence it is, that while the forming operateth in the ſeed and womb of the mother, if any ſpecies be ſent to the imagination of the mother which ſhe ſtrongly receives, it may make an impreſſion upon the child, yet every imagination cannot make this impreſſion, but that which makes a great admiration or terror in the mother when the forming faculty is at work, as when ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds one with ſix fingers, ſhe brings forth the like, or when ſhe produceth hair where it ſhould not be, or the likeneſs of a beaſt in any limb, or when ſhe ſeeth any thing cut or divided with a cleaver, ſhe brings forth a divided part, or a Hare-lip.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall give my opinion with others.</p>
                     <p>Two things are to be obſerved in this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hiſtory; Firſt, Why the Child in the time of travail being dead in the womb, did not ſtink as is uſual, or kill the mother ſuddenly or was not caſt out by degrees being rotten? Secondly, By what force the child was turned into Stone?</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, The mother lived twenty eight years after ſhe had this Child; therefore it is not credible that the womb was ſo cold, that it might hinder putrefaction, as ſome think. It ſeems more probable to be, that theſe queſtions expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation depend upon one principle; for the cauſe that made the ſtones hardneſs, kept the child from putrefaction, but what that is, it is obſcure.</p>
                     <p>Many fly to the efficiency of the firſt qualities, others to drineſs, others to coldneſs, others to both. I acknowledge heat, cold and drineſs to he helping cauſes for breeding of Stones in mans body; but the chief cauſe is a Stone breeding juyce, or ſpirit, of which I have ſpoken at large.</p>
                     <p>The principles of Generation were weak in this child, and impure, and this ſtone breeding juyce, was mixed with the blood in the humors; hence it is, that it was not born alive, as in a mole bred in the womb, which women have till they are old and die with it, and yet it ſtinks not
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:153163:83"/> no more then ſtones bred in moſt parts. But there is but this Hiſtory of ſuch a Birth.</p>

                     <p>IT is fleſh and maſs without bones or bowels, gotten of an imperfect conception inſtead of a child. The Latins call it a Mole from the weight, becauſe it is troubleſome to women, as a Milſtone in Latin called <hi>Lapis Moralis.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <note place="margin">The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</note>Sometimes it is unſhapen fleſh without bones, only full of veins, with a ſkin over it, and nothing within, but like the Parenchyma of the bowels. Sometimes it is membranous and fibrous,<note place="margin">Pet. Salis diu. in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum.</note> without ſhape. Sometimes it is long, round, or like a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of glaſs, or like a brute beaſt. Some have brought forth three Moles like mens yards.</p>
                     <p>Some are like congealed blood, or the Placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta of the womb, into which the navel-veſſels are inſerted; ſome grow and are nouriſhed, and ſome have an obſcure ſenſe. Sometimes they are ſent out alone, ſometimes with or before the child, of which there are many Hiſtories. Some bring forth Monſters for Moles.</p>
                     <p>In is from the error of the forming faculty, but the Cauſe of that is obſcure.<note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note> I ſuppoſe it is from both ſeeds, when the forming faculty is weak, and the ſeed little and not good, and overcome by much blood, and can make only veins and membranes, and not a whole child. Sometimes it is in Widows only from their own ſeed and blood.</p>
                     <p>A Mole is ſooner bred when the blood is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and unfit to nouriſh, and is made when they copulate in the flowing of the terms that are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:153163:83"/> unclean. It is neither from heat nor cold princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, but from the error of the forming faculty.</p>
                     <p>They are hard to be known before the fourth month,<note place="margin">The Signs.</note> then they are known by ſuch as can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the motion of wind and a child. 2. If a woman turn from ſide to ſide, it falls like a ſtone to that ſide ſhe lies on, and is heavy. If it have any motion, it is trembling and beating, with conſtruction and dilation like a Spunge. If after the time that the child ſhould move, there be no motion, and the belly ſwells, and there is no ſign of a Dropſie, it is a ſign of a Mole.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In women with child, there is Milk about the fourth month, but in a Mole the breaſts ſwell, but there is no true milk. 4. They are more pained and faint, and have more pain in their back and groyns.</p>
                     <p>If it be with a quick child, it is hard to be known, but it is known by its weight in the womb, which ſhe perceives when ſhe gets up to walk, or moves from ſide to ſide; ſome are then ſtrong and well coloured.</p>
                     <p>It hurts the womb and whole body;<note place="margin">The Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick.</note> if it be divided, it is leſs dangerous: when it is ſoft, it is caſt out the third or fourth month. Sometimes it ulcerates or tears the womb, and cauſeth great bleeding. Some have been caſt out or drawn out without danger: ſome grow old with them in,<note place="margin">Fabr. cont. <hi>2.</hi> obſ. <hi>55.</hi> The Cure.</note> and find no inconvenience but the weight.</p>
                     <p>To prevent, take heed of Venery in the terms, or before the terms, or when the body is ſoul or obſtructed, or the womb.</p>
                     <p>When it is,<note place="margin">

                        <p>To ſpeak freely of this which many doubt; I ſuppoſe that many are made of a weak mans ſeed, mixed with the woman ſeed, and much blood. But Hiſtories confirm that Widows have had them without mans ſeed, but not of the ſhape with the others. And being voided, they melted being in the air, into water.</p>
                        <p>I think Virgins cannot have them but from wantonneſs, or in ſleep they may ſpend their ſeed; but becauſe it is weak, and the blood ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for formation, neither is drawn by the womb, nor flows to it of its own accord, as it doth in thoſe that have had children, and the veſſels of the womb in Virgins are ſtraiter than in Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and others that have had children. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the ſeed of Virgins flow into the womb, yet they cannot have a Mole for want of blood, which is neceſſary for the forming of the ſame. This is to be underſtood of Moles which are not vital, for vital Moles that have ſome life, cannot be got in Virgins or Widdows without the ſeed of Man.</p>

                        <hi>Gaſper Bauhin</hi> ſpeaks of one <hi>Anne Troporim,</hi> which 1575. brought forth two Serpents with her child; In Harveſt hot weather, ſhe had drunk water in a Brook in a Wood near <hi>Baſil,</hi> where ſhe thought ſhe drank the Spawn of a Serpent; for a little after that, her belly ſwelled, and three months after ſhe was big with child, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents grew as the Child did. Her belly was ſo big that ſhe carried it in a ſwathing band. She was delivered at laſt of a lean male child, and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſuſpect Worms or Snakes from the gnawing and ſtrange motion ſhe felt that year,) they put a baſon of milk under her, and when they expected an after-birth, out came a Serpent which ſhe ſaw, and perceived another coming forth, they were an ell long, and as thick as a childs arm. Thus <hi>Bauhin,</hi> and he ſpeaks of others, if you pleaſe to peruſe him.</p>
                     <p>A Monſter is that which is either wholly, or in part like a beaſt, or that which is ill ſhaped extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</p>
                     <p>Hiſtories witneſs, that a Monſter may be from humane ſeed,<note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note> and the ſeed of a beaſt. It is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for the forming faculty doth not err of it ſelf, but is ſeduced by the imagination, or fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated of its ends, from a fault of the Spirits, the heat or matter. Therefore imagination is the cauſe of Monſters. For Hiſtories mention, That women with child, by beholding men in vizards, have brought forth Monſters with horns, and beaks, and cloven feet. The ſame is when Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:153163:85"/> or heat, ſeed or blood, are weak or little.</p>
                     <p>And though Doctors cannot cure Monſters, yet they are to admoniſh women with child not to look upon Monſters, and to ſtrengthen their ſpirits and heat, and to keep the ſeed and blood right, and not to allow copulation in time of their terms, leſt any monſtrous Birth ſhould be from much and impure blood.</p>

                     <p>The terms flow not as in a true Conception,<note place="margin">The Signs.</note> but in this there is pain of the head, loyns, belly, and groyns, of which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith thus:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Prorrhet.</hi>

                        <p>Therefore if bleeding be required in a Feaver, or the like, and the woman with child be in ſtrength, you may boldly let blood upon theſe conditions. 1. That you take not nouriſhment from the child, let it be a little, and you will take more, do it the ſecond time, leſt you weaken. 2. Open not the foot nor the Baſilica, but the Mediana. 3.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:153163:89"/> and provokes the terms. But bleeding diſturbs the humors leſs, nor doth hurt any way, but by taking nouriſhment from the child. And this you need not fear, if there be too much blood. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purging is more dangerous then bleeding.</p>

                        <p>But if to preſerve the mother, the Phyſitian purge or bleed, and the abortion follow, the fault is not in the Phyſitian that intended it not, but in the weakneſs of Nature, and of the Child; and is better to preſerve the Mother, then by neglecting the lawful means, let both die.

                        <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> Of the Symptoms that befal Women with Child in the firſt Months.</head>
                     <p>THey are loathing meat, Pica, or evil appetite, pewking, vomiting, belly-ach, flux of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, tooth and head-ach, giddineſs.</p>
                     <p>Theſe all come from the ſtoppage of the terms, eſpecially in a Cacochymy or evil juyce: for it goes to the ſtomach, and ſo to the head. Firſt, They loath meat,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Apho.</hi> 45.</note> which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, is a ſign of Conception. And this is when the child takes the pureſt blood, and leaves the impure, which gets into the mouth of the ſtomach, and infects it, and hence comes the loathing of ſome ſorts of meats.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes this ceaſeth of it ſelf; but if there be danger of a Conſumption in the mother, leſt the child ſhould be in danger for want of food, give a gentle Vomit or Stomach-Pills, with things that ſtrengthen the Stomach. As, Take <hi>Conſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> of red Roſes half an ounce, of Bettony an ounce, preſerved Quinces three drams, Aromaticum Roſatum half a dram, Pearl prepared half a ſcruple, with Syrup of green Ginger and Quinces, make an Electuary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Anoint the ſtomach with oyl of Maſtich, Mints, Quinces, Wormwood, Mirtles, &amp;c. Give aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents and powerful things with meat, and let it be roaſted rather then boyled.</p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:153163:90"/>
                     <p>Pica is when they deſire ſtrange and abſurd things, as Coals, Aſhes, &amp;c. As ſhe that longed for her husbands fleſh, and though ſhe loved him very well; ſhe killed him, eat part, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered up the reſt. Of this diſeaſe we ſpake in the third Book.</p>
                     <p>Juyce of young Vine-leaves with Syrup of Quinces, is good againſt this, or the water that drops in <hi>May</hi> from the Vines. This keeps the child from ſuffering by the mothers appetite.</p>
                     <p>Or this Spirit. Take <hi>Citron-peels, Oranges, Piony-roots as much as you pleaſe, and Malmſey, digeſt them ſome dayes, then beat the roots and peels, add more Malmſey, and diſtil them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third is loathing and vomiting, from an evil vapour or humour in the ſtomach from blood retained. If vomiting give her eaſe, ſtop it not, but leave it to nature, it will ceaſe after a month or two. If it be with trouble, give a gentle Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or ſtrengthen the ſtomach, or give a little Rhubarb.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is pain of the belly, from wind and humors about the womb that go to the guts, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs them as in Chap. 3. <hi>Of the Cholick.</hi> Avoid moiſt Fomentations, give Cinnamon-water, or ſpiced wine.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is a looſneſs which muſt be ſuddenly ſtopt, leſt it cauſe an abortion. Firſt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hippocr.</hi> 5. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 34.</note> give a gentle cleanſer and ſtrengthener, as Rhubarb with ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Roſes ſolutive, then Quinces at the firſt courſe at meals; and Rice, Starch, Almonds, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Roſes, Quinces. Apply to the navel a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis of Quinces, Maſtich, Nutmegs, Mace, Cloves.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth is the Tooth-ach, from a ſharp humor from retention of the terms that goes to the root of ſome tooth, and hurts the membranes. It cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:153163:91"/> commonly of it ſelf, yet if it be great, uſe a Plaiſter of Maſtich and Tacamahacca to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and hold in the mouth the decoction of Fern-roots, Cinquefoyl, Snakeweed, Sage, Mulberry-barks, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventh is Head-ach, when the vapors from the terms ſtopt, aſcend and twitch the membranes of the brain, it muſt be repelled and abated with Lenitives, of which in <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Part</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Of Head-ach.</hi>

                     <p>The eighth of the Megrim, from the vapors diſturbing the Spirits that go to the head by the veins and arteries, or by the gullet. If it ceaſe not, diſcuſs vapors, and ſtrengthen the brain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and outwardly as in Vertigo.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>Chap. 5.</hi> Of the Symptoms in Women with Child in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Months.</head>
                     <p>THey are cough, heart-beating, fainting, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pains in the loyns and hips, and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The cough is from a ſharp vapor that comes to the jaws and rough artery from the terms, or from a thin part of that blood gotten into the veins of the breaſt, or falling from the head to the breaſt. This endangers abortion, and ſtrength fails from watching; therefore purge the humors that fall from the head to the breaſt, with Rhubarb, Agarick, and ſtrengthen the head as in a Catarrh, and give ſweet Lenitives, as in a Cough.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Palpitation of heart and fainting, is from vapors that go to it by the arteries, or from blood
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:153163:91"/> that aboundeth, and cannot get out at the womb, but aſcends and oppreſſeth the heart. Uſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials as in Syncope inwardly and outwardly.</p>
                     <p>If it be from too much blood, as in Plethory, open a vein.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Watching is from dry ſharp vapors that trouble the animal Spirits. Then uſe Frictions and waſh the feet at bed time, and give Syrup of Poppies, dryed Roſes, Emulſions of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and white Poppy-ſeeds.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is pain in the loyns and hips from the weight of the child, or from the terms ſtopt, or growth of the child, that ſtretcheth the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the womb and parts adjacent; if there be Plethory, bleed. If it be from weight of the child, hold it up with ſwathing Bands about the neck.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There is flux of bood at the womb, noſe, or Hoemorrhoids from plenty, or from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the child that takes it not in, or from evil humors in the blood, that ſtir up nature to ſend it forth. Alſo the veſſels of the Womb may be broken or torn by motion, fall, cough, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of mind. This is dangerous,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 60.</note> of which <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> ſaith, The child cannot be well, if it be from blood only, there is leſs danger, ſo it flows by the veins of the neck of the womb, for it takes away Plethory, or take not nouriſhment from the child.</p>
                     <p>If it be from the weakneſs of the child that draws it not, abortion often follows, or hard tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, or ſhe goes beyond her time. If it flow by the inward veins of the womb, there is more danger by the openneſs of the womb. If it come from evil blood, the danger is alike from Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy which is like to fall upon both. If there
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:153163:92"/> be Plethory, open a vein warily, and uſe aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. As, Take <hi>Pearls prepared a ſcruple, red Coral two ſcruples, Mace, Nutmegs, each a dram; Cinnamon half a dram, make a powder, or with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Rouls: or give this powder in Broth.</hi> Take <hi>red Coral a dram, Pearl half a dram, pretious Stones, each half a ſcruple; red Sanders half a dram, Bole a dram, ſealed Earth, Tormentil-roots, each two ſcruples; with Sugar of Roſes and Manus Chriſti, with Pearl ſix drams, make a powder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may ſtrengthen the child at the navel. If there be Cacochymy alter the humors, and (if you may) evacuate. You may uſe Amulets in the hands, and about the neck. In flux of Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids, beware of the pain. Let her drink hot Wine with a roaſted Nutmeg.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THe Urin is ſtopt from ſuppreſſion of the neck of the bladder. Let her then lye down, and let the bladder be fomented with a Bag of Pellitory, Parſly-roots, Mallows, Linſeed, and the like, or uſe the Catheter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The belly is bound from a hot and dry Liver, when the child draws all the moiſture to it, or preſſeth the guts. Let her then uſe Moiſtners, as Butter, Mallows, Borage in Broaths; or that Clyſters in a ſmall quantity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The veins appear in the hips and legs as varicous only, then keep them from walking, and let their feet be laid upon a ſtool.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The legs ſwell from ſerous blood, but this goes away with the After-birth, and is the ſigns of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:153163:92"/> a female child; but if ſhe cannot walk, foment with Lye made of Vine branches and Wine, or with a Decoction or Organ, Penny-royal, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, Calamints. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Bean and Lupine-flour, each two ounces; Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar an ounce, Pidgeons-dung half an ounce, with ſteel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-water and juyce of Coleworts, make a Pultis. Rub and waſh the feet with ſalt water in which Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, Organ and Dill were boyled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The ſkin of the belly is cleft with ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the fourth month; therefore uſe looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Liniments to keep off deformity, as marrow of Veal, and Sheeps-legs, Oyl of ſweet Almonds, Hens-greaſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The water gathered in time of being with Child, between the membranes that hold the Child, comes forth too ſoon, becauſe the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes are broken by leaping, or a contuſion. This makes difficult birth, for that water was to moiſten the parts. Therefore let her keep a good diet, and ſtrengthen the child inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>

                     <p>To hinder abortion and death of the child, know rightly the weakneſs, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Aph.</hi> 53.</note> 
                        <hi>They that will abort, have firſt breaſts that fall away,</hi> which is from want of nouriſhment in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon veins of the womb and breaſts,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Aph.</hi> 52.</note> 
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath a ſecond ſign, which is this: <hi>If a Woman

When the mother hath a flux of the belly, the child is weak. 6. When it begins to move, and is ſcarce felt, it is weak.</p>
                     <p>If it be from theſe cauſes, take them away, and ſtrengthen the child, firſt ſeed the mother high with meats of good juyce, and ſweet Almonds ſteept in Honey, Raiſins, Quinces, outwardly thus: Take <hi>Malmſey three pints, diſſolve it in Oyl of Nutmegs by expreſſion half an ounce, add powder of Cloves, Rue, each half an ounce; Roſe, Sage, Marjoram, Penny-royal-water, each a pint; Aqua-vitae three ounces.</hi> Dip Spunges in it, and apply them under the left breaſt, to the arm-pits, hams, pulſes, ſoles of the feet, and when they dry, wet them again.</p>

                     <p>CHildren have ſometimes cryed in the womb, as <hi>Fabricius</hi> ſaith in his Epiſtle to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>James Fincel,</hi> and <hi>Weinridick</hi> of Monſters, writes thus: <hi>In this City of</hi> Breſſa <hi>a Child was heard to cry in the Womb three daies before the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; when he was a man, he was miſerable with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and diſeaſes, till he died.

                     <p>WHen the Child can no longer be contained in ſo ſmall a place, being grown, and requiring more nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, it kicks, and breaks the Membranes and Ligaments that held it, and the Womb by an expelling faculty, ſends it forth with great ſtraining, and this is called Travel.</p>
                     <p>It is either natural or not natural, legitimate
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:153163:94"/> or illegitimate. The natural is when the child comes with the head forward and heels upwards, with his hands and arms to his thighs, and ſo the other parts eaſily follow, then the Amnios is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the water that was laid up in time of being with child flows forth, and moiſtens the paſſages, then the child with more force breaks the Acetabula, from which the Secundine is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and the other membranes are broken, and the blood flows into the cavity of the womb, and the child gets out by the expulſive faculty with ſuch force, that it ſeems to fall rather then be expelled, and the bones of the Privities muſt needs be divided.</p>
                     <p>That which follows the birth is above humane capacity, namely, The tranſmiration of the Navel-veſſels, and Lungs, and Heart in the Infant, and why Nature ordered it, of which <hi>Galen</hi> elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the 15th Book, <hi>Of the Uſe of Parts,</hi> and 6th Chapter.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a legitimate Birth, when it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of Nature; and an illegitimate, when it is before or after the time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Lib. de ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim. paren.</note> That a Birth in the ſeventh month is vital and legitimate. And it is ſooner from the ſtrength of the faculty and matter fit for formation, yet it is commonly weak, except the ſeventh month be compleat</p>
                     <p>Of the eighth month <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith thus: <hi>None lives that is born in the eighth month, becauſe it cannot bear the two afflictions to follow,</hi> but the reaſon of the Arithmaticians is better, that ſay, an even month is imperfect.</p>
                     <p>The ninth or tenth months are the beſt,<note place="margin">Lib. de na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura pueri Lib.

                     <p>But when ſhe hath pains from the navel to the groyns, and in the back, then the ligaments, and veſſels are broken, by which the child grows to the womb. And becauſe the Womb violently ſtrains to diſcharge it; the membranous fibres are extended, and commonly there are very great pains, and throws, or the child will not be born, and it is an evil ſign when throws ceaſe, becauſe the expulſive faculty is weakned. And let not the Midwife provoke throws till the time.</p>
                     <p>When the Membranes are broken, the water flows out, that comes from the urin and ſweat of the child, firſt little, then more, then wateriſh blood, and the orifice of the womb begins to open to let out the child. And before this time, you muſt not provoke throws. Then let the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife put her finger into the orifice of the womb, and ſhe ſhall perceive ſomething round and hard as an Egg.

                        <hi>Mathias Cornax</hi> hath a Hiſtory of one that carried a dead child in her belly four years, it was taken out by cutting the womb and belly, and the mother lived, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with child after: ſhe fainted not at the time, and the wound grew together without ſtit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; and her terms after came in good order, and ſhe had a luſty Boy till the ſecond of <hi>June.</hi> The Surgeons that had cut her afore were ſent for, and the old orifice was open, and the mother and the women preſent, would not yield to the ſecond cutting. Therefore her ſtrength failed, and the Chyrurgion took out a compleat child, but it was dead.</p>
                     <p>There are more Hiſtories of live children cut out of their mothers bellies being dead.

But take heed it be not ſuffocated in the womb, and keep the mothers mouth open, and let the Midwife never move her hand from the Privities,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> de diſect. part. cor. hum. c. <hi>1.</hi>

                     <p>When a live child is cut out of the belly of a live mother, it is done only leſt the mother or child, or both ſhould die.</p>
                     <p>And this may be done, and both preſerved alive, which is plainly demonſtrated by <hi>Francis Rouſſet,</hi> in his Book of this ſubject, ſo that there is no doubt of it. For firſt he ſhews the neceſſity of the Operation, and next the poſſibility of it, ſhewing that the muſcles of the belly, the Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum and Womb may be cut without hazard of life.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He confirms by Hiſtory what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by reaſon, and ſhews that many wounds of the muſcles in the lower belly, Peritonaeum and Womb have been cured.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He propounds many more dangerous caſes then the Caeſarean Section, which were not deadly in themſelves. And then he ſhews the manner of the operation, and how it is to be done. Therefore have recourſe to his works, if thou wilt learn it.</p>

                     <p>THey have often continual Feavers. The firſt is the Feaver of Milk about the fourth or third day from the motion of the blood from the womb to the breaſts; it is not of many dayes continuance, and is not dangerous.</p>
                     <p>But take heed you miſtake not a putrid Feaver for a Milk-feaver, for labour and pain ſometimes inflame the humors, and cauſe putrefaction, and though the Symptomes appear not the next day after delivery, yet there may be the beginning of putrefaction from the heat of the humors in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, eſpecially if the after-flux be ſtopt, from which time you muſt count the beginning of the diſeaſes. For a Feaver cannot be long concealed, nor the motion from Travel laſt long: therefore it is probable the motion is ceaſed, and the Feaver comes of another cauſe, which I ſhall declare preſently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note>They are the ſtoppage of the After-flux, or the diminiſhing of it, or the foul humors that were gathered in the time of being with child, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Travel. Too great purging of the After-blood or Lochia ſignifies Cacochymy, or a Feaver that will come long after Travel. If the Lochia flow not in due time, or be ſtopt, then the blood and foul humors go back to the great Veins and Liver,<note place="margin">Hippocr. <hi>1.</hi> epid. tex. <hi>21.</hi> The Signs</note> and make a putrid Feaver, or inflame thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p>A Feaver from milk comes the fourth day, and there is heavineſs of back and ſhoulders, and the Lochia flow well, it not, there is the ſign of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:153163:108"/> If the humors putrifie in the womb, there is foul ſtinking matter voided, the belly is ſwollen, and is pained when toucht. If the Feaver be not from milk, and the Lochia flow, it comes from bad humors, eſpecially if when ſhe was big with child, ſhe kept not a good diet.</p>
                     <p>A Feaver from milk is without danger,<note place="margin">The Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick.</note> and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the eighth or tenth day: that which comes from ſuppreſſion of the Lochia or After-flux, is dangerous and often deadly, except there follow a flux of the belly. If black ſtinking matter flow from the womb, they eſcape: If the Feaver come from a Cacochymy before Delivery, it is worſe, becauſe it argues much humors, which Nature cannot diſcharge by the after-flux, and the ſtrength is dejected by hard travel.</p>
                     <p>A Feaver from milk, requires only good diet,<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> and ſweating muſt not be hindred, for it cures. That which is from ſtoppage or diminiſhing of the Lochia, muſt be cured by provoking the after-flux, or by another evacuation inſtead of it; as purging, bleeding in the foot to provoke the flux, or by ſcarifying the thighs and legs, after cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, while the time is, that the after-flux ſhould be not afterwards. For if that time be paſt, if ſtrength permit, open a vein in the arm, and bleed plentifully.</p>
                     <p>For purging: ſome purge them in a Pleuriſie after the ſeventh day,<note place="margin">Valer. lib. <hi>5.</hi> obſ. <hi>10.</hi> merc. <hi>4.</hi> de morb. mul. c. <hi>11.</hi>
                        </note> but beware by reaſon of the weakneſs after travel, and becauſe Purges may hinder the after-flux, which is dangerous, it is good to evacuate only by the womb; but if the flux of blood ceaſe, and Nature would purge ſomething from the womb, you may give a gentle Purge of Rhubarb, Caſſia, Manna, Syrup of Roſes, Senna.</p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:153163:109"/>
                     <p>Alterers are thus to be ordered. Avoid too cold and ſharp things, leſt the evacuation by the womb ſhould be diſturbed by cold things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Diet.</note>Let it be thin the firſt daies of lying in, then thicker, and ſo increaſing, take heed of too much drink, eſpecially of cold drink.</p>

                           <hi>Queſtion.</hi> What Veins are to be opened in Women that lie in, and have a Pleuriſie?</head>
                        <p>They have Symptomatical Feavers; alſo from inflammation of the Pleura, Jaws or Liver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome of the foul humors are ſent to ſome private part, and make an inflammation to which the Feaver is joyned, and the cauſes are as before mentioned.</p>
                        <p>If there be a Pleuriſie, ſhe is in great danger. The Queſtion is, Whether ſhe muſt bleed above or below? I ſay thus: Firſt, This Feaver is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Symptomatical, but primary, and hath the inflammation its aſſociate, while nature ſends part of the matter to the Pleura or other part.</p>
                        <p>Secondly Note, That Nature is in an error while ſhe ſends the vitious humors, which ſhe ſhould expel by the womb to the Pleura.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly Note, That the vitious motion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not to be helped therefore, which ſhould be done, if you ſhould preſently open a vein in the arm: but the blood is to be voided by the womb which is Natures way.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, If the Pleuriſie be not abated by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening a vein in the ankle for revulſion, but the Symptoms continue or increaſe, you muſt not continue to open the veins beneath, becauſe they evacuate not from the part affected, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in ſuch a dangerous diſeaſe. It is a ſign
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:153163:109"/> that the matter is faſtned to the part, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not again be brought to the womb by revulſion. Therefore then you may open a vein in the arm on the ſame ſide, to evacuate and drive the blood from the part or there about, or ſhe will be in danger of death.</p>
                        <p>And fear not, that Nature will be taken from her ordinary motion towards the womb thereby, for the vein that was opened in the foot, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that: and if you fear any danger, you may prevent it by Frictions and cupping of the leggs, while you let blood in the arm.</p>
                        <p>And you may give Clyſters, that may cauſe the humors moving upwards, to come down, and looſen the paſſages of the womb, that blood may flow out the better.</p>
                        <p>As, Take <hi>Pellitory of the Wall, Mallows, Althaea, red Coleworts, each a handful; Chammomil-flowers half a handful, Foenugreek and Linſeed, each half an ounce; boyl them in Water, to a pint ſtrained, add lenitive Electuary an ounce, Diacatholicon or Caſſia half an ounce, Oyl of Violets two ounces, make a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Feaver abate, and the time of the flux of the Lochia be paſt, give a gentle Purge.</p>
                        <p>Cure the reſt as an ordinary Pleuriſie, onely take heed that while the After flux laſts, you give no binding Medicine.</p>
                        <p>Alſo ſhe may have a Quinzy while ſhe lies in, while the vicious matter flows to the jaws. The Cure of which bleeding is to be done as in the Pleuriſie, but the reſt is to be done as in the Quinzy.</p>
                        <p>And if the Liver be inflamed by the motion of the humors to it, you muſt bleed as in the Pleuriſie and Quinzy. Yet it is not ſo needful
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:153163:110"/> in the Arm as in the Pleuriſie, by reaſon of the greater diſtance of the Liver from the Arm, for the Pleura and the Breaſt are nearer, and conſent more with the Arms, but the Vein in the Legg is near to the hollow Vein, as the diſtribution of the upper Veins to the Arms.</p>
                        <p>The reſt of the Cure of the Inflammation of the Liver, is in <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. onely obſerve that you muſt not uſe too great Coolers or Binders in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Child-bed, but things that are of thin parts, leſt the flux called <hi>Lochia</hi> or After-blood, ſhould be ſtopped.</p>

                     <p>THere are many Cauſes of want of Milk, either there is little Blood to breed it, or the milk-making Faculty in the Breaſt that makes Milk, is not right, or the Inſtruments for blood-making are diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the matter is conſumed by a Feaver
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:153163:118"/> or faſting, when they loath meat, or from care or labour, evacuations, ſweats, or looſe belly. Or from weakneſs of the Infant that cannot draw hard. Alſo ſadneſs, fear and the like, may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der blood from flowing to the Breaſts.</p>
                     <p>Milk is wanting when the Breaſts are flaggy,<note place="margin">The Signs.</note> and ſwell not, and little milk is ſucked out. The ſigns of the Cauſes thus: If it be from the Liver, there will be ſigns of its diſtemper: if from great evacuation, that is known: the fault is known to be in the breaſts, if as oft as they lie in, they have no milk, and the breaſts are ſmall and wrinkled; or if Medicines to keep down the breaſts, have been applied, ſhe will tell you: or if it be from weakneſs of the child, or paſſions of mind.</p>
                     <p>The inconvenience is little to the Nurſe,<note place="margin">The Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick.</note> but great to the Child; therefore get another Nurſe, or cure her.</p>
                     <p>To breed milk,<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> give things that breed much and good blood, of eaſie concoction. Medicines to breed milk, are Fennel-roots, and all green things that heat, and are not very dry, which are few, but infinite are they that hinder milk, as things hot and dry, and cold things.</p>
                     <p>Theſe increaſe Milk, Roots of Smallage, Seeds of Parſley, Dill, Baſil, Aniſe, Rocket, Earth-worms waſht in juyce of Fennel and dried, or burnt in a pot a dram or two, faſting for ſome mornings, or Cryſtal or Milk-ſtone a dram.</p>

                     <p>THe change of colour in the Nipples, is not a ſign of the loſs of Virginity, for they are blew in them that give ſuck; black in old women; and in them that have known Venery, it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and red as a Strawberry. Now becauſe there is a great conſent between the Womb and Breaſts, if the Womb be diſtempered, the Nipples are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured.</p>

                     <p>The pain in the breaſts, is from ſtretching by much milk, and inflammation: or from corroſion and twitching, from ſharp matter, as in the Cancer and other Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of the pain is known from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. If it be from much milk, it is a gentle pain. If from inflammation, it is ſtronger. If from a Cancer, it is very great.</p>

Let it not be after her firſt child, and let not her milk be too old or too new, of ten months old at the moſt.

                     <p>They are all ulcers chiefly in the head, with holes that run with matter conſtantly.</p>

                     <p>IF Achores or Favi laſt long, or are ill cured, they turn to a Scald, which is a ſcabby Ulcer that corrodes the ſkin, and ſtinks; it is called <hi>Tinea</hi> or Moth which eats Garments, as this doth

                     <p>After the ſcab is off, pull the hair out by the roots, with inſtruments or medicines; common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they uſe a pitched cap, and pull it off violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which bring away the hair.

                     <p>LIce are Creatures which breed in cloths that are conſtantly worn, but they are chiefly in children from the excrements of the head.</p>
                     <p>All ſay, That filth and naſtineſs alone is the cauſe of Lice; but I think not, for filth alone cannot do it without heat, for beſides the firſt qualities, there is a hidden force in the matter by which it is diſpoſed to produce a particular ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; for Fleas and Worms will not breed of that matter which breeds Lice, ſo it is in Plants.</p>
                     <p>Heat is the helping cauſe which raiſeth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal force, and brings it into act, and though the matter be putrid, it doth not work upon it, but as it is ſomewhat natural.</p>
                     <p>Excrements are not preſently putrid, but there is in them a heat that can raiſe forming force, and though there is ſome putrefaction, yet is it not ſo great as to hinder the action, hence it is, that children and women that are hot and moiſt have many excrements that are fit to breed Lice.<note place="margin">Gal. oriba Auſc.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some meats breed Lice, as Figs by their fat juyce which doth naturally tend to the ſkin, and varieties of meats, and not cleanſing nor combe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                        </note>THe ſtone in the bladder is uſual in Infants, as that of the kidnies is in elder people. How it is cured, we ſhewed before. In Infants it is from groſs unclean milk made of tough meats, this too much taken in cauſeth crudities fit to breed the ſtone, or pap of Barley-meal and milk may cauſe it. There is alſo a weakneſs in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Stomach, when they do not ſeparate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable food, but much earthy juyce remains in the chyle that breeds ſtones. Alſo a hot diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the reins, by which the chyle is drawn to the bladder, and if there be a native hereditary diſpoſition to breed the ſtone, an earthy part is in the humor, which makes the urine thick; this is in bigger Boyes more then in Infants.</p>
                     <p>They piſs by drops, with itching and pain, the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:153163:141"/> urine is ſtopt often, and that which is piſſed is like clear water white, or like milk or whey, ſometimes blood is piſſed, and the yard often ſtands.</p>
                     <p>It increaſeth daily, if it be not oppoſed,<note place="margin">The Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick.</note> and cannot be cured without cutting, which is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for young or old.</p>
                     <p>Prevent the breeding of it when you ſee the leaſt diſpoſition to it.<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> Let the belly be alwaies kept looſe, and the Nurſe eat no groſs ſlimy food: make a bath of the decoction of Althaea. Mallows, Pellitory, Parſley, Dill, Foenugreek, Lineſeed, then anoint the bladder with Althaea, Oyl of Lillies and Scorpions, and apply a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm of Pellitory, boyled with Oyl of Lillies.</p>

                     <p>SOmetimes children and men grow lean; the elder from Feavers, Conſumptions, and other diſeaſes; but children pine away, and the cauſe is not known, and though they eat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form other actions, they are not nouriſhed nor grow.</p>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:153163:143"/>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Cauſes.</note>The cauſes of Conſumption in Infants, are little or bad milk by which no blood is bred fit to nouriſh the body, ſo that they thrive not till they change the Nurſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is worms that ſucks away the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</p>
                     <p>The third is worms about the body without, as in the Back, Arms, or Legs, and all parts, theſe are very ſmall, and breed in muſculous parts, and ſtick in the ſkin, and never come wholly out, but after rubbing in baths, they put forth their heads like black hairs, and run in when they feel the cold air; they breed of ſlimy matter ſhut up in the capillar veins, which turns to worms from tranſpiration hindred.</p>
                     <p>The fourth cauſe in the opinion of people, is faſcination or witchcraft, either from the eyes of Witches, or by vapors, or by touch, or by words from a Witch; theſe are alledged by many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. I neither allow nor plainly deny all theſe waies of faſcination, though it is not credible that a child ſhould ſuffer by words or looks only. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not but diſeaſes may be ſent from ſick bodies to others, as the Leproſie, the French Pox, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and the like, and many infect Infants. And I believe that they may be hurt by Witches and malitious perſons by the help of the Devil and Gods permiſſion,<note place="margin">Baſ. in hode invidia.</note> as <hi>Baſil</hi> the Great writeth: for wicked people make a league with the Devil that they may hurt ſuch as they look enviouſly and angerly upon. And I add one thing, A habit of body that is grown very excellent, is in moſt danger, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, When children come to be very healthful and fair, they fall ſuddenly into a diſeaſe, and the vulgar not knowing the cauſe of it, impute it to Witchcraft.</p>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:153163:143"/>
                     <p>The ſigns of the cauſes,<note place="margin">The Signs.</note> if they be lean from a Feaver or other diſeaſe, it is eaſily known. If theſe cauſes be not, view the Nurſes milk: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little, or her breaſts flag without milk, and that is the cauſe of leanneſs in the child, if ſhe have milk, ſee if it be not hot and dry, and chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick. And conſider her Conſtitution. If the milk be blameleſs, ſee if it be not from worms ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the guts or in the ſkin; the worms in the ſkin are known by putting the child into a bath and rubbing it, eſpecially on the back with the hand, and with Honey and Bread, and then you ſhall ſee little aſh-coloured or black hairs come out of the ſkin.</p>
                     <p>If there be no outward nor inward cauſe, you may miſtruſt a venemous vapour or witchcraft.</p>
                     <p>If it be for want of milk, change the Nurſe.<note place="margin">The Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick.</note> If it be from worms in the ſkin, it is not hard to be cured; if it be from an occult quality, or from witchcraft, it is hard to be cured, becauſe we know not the nature of the malignity.</p>
                     <p>If the Nurſe have any diſeaſe,<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> or be contrary to the conſtitution of the child, change her, kill and caſt out the worms. If it be from worms in the back, rub it, and anoint it with Honey and Wheat-bread, and when their heads come forth, kill them with a Razor or cruſt of bread. Do this often.</p>
                     <p>There are many ſuperſtitious things carried about againſt witchcraft, ſome hang Amber and Coral about the childs neck, nor is it impoſſible that Plants and Gems ſhould have power againſt witchcraft. As, Briony-root, and Elks-hoof are good againſt the Epilepſie, alſo there are Amulets againſt other Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>If leanneſs be from a dry diſtemper of the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:153163:144"/> whole body, there is no better Remedy then often bathing in a Decoction of Mallows, Althaea, Branck-urſine, Sheeps-heads, and the like, and anoint after with the Oyl of ſweet Almonds.</p>
                     <p>If he be hot and dry, add to the Bath Lettice, Endive, Violets, Poppy-heads, and anoint after with Oyl of Roſes and Violets.</p>
